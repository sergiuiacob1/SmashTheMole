Addictive game, developed using SDL

My first CS project, which I have worked on in my first year of highschool (also my first year studying CS) with 2 other colleagues.
It's an addictive game with a nice story. You should definitely give it a try and test your skills! :)

This was done before knowing about OOP, design patterns and so on.

To get into the game, run joculet.exe
